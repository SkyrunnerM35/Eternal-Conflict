0.6.3 alpha 9/13/2019
 * Added Designator Missile.

0.6.2 alpha 9/9/2019
 * *insert Cirno Day comment here*
 * Chance for catastrophic failure when overriding automatic shutdown is no longer a fixed 20%. Instead,
   it now starts at 5% and increases by an additional 5% for every override performed.

0.6.1 alpha 9/7/2019
 * Added the environmental effect Planetary Rings.
 * Dodge rate for dreadnought volleys in the Fleet Battle environment will not drop below 40% anymore;
   hence, getting caught in a Fleet Battle with your engines damaged is no longer a guaranteed death
   sentence. This 40% minimum dodge rate does not apply to other environmental effects which do damage,
   such as Planetary Defenses.
 * Enemy ship should now make heavier use of its Missile Launcher.

0.6.0 alpha 9/6/2019
 * Added environmental effects; each effect will last somewhere between 3 to 8 turns, after which there
   will be a chance every turn to switch environments.
 * Current environments include Open Space (no effects), Stellar Proximity, Asteroid Field, Planetary
   Defenses (allied and enemy), and Fleet Battle, with more coming soon.
 * Fixed bug where afterburn damage ignored shields.

0.5.0 alpha 8/31/2019
 * Implemented status effects.
 * Added Corrosion Missile, Thermite Bomb, and EMP Cannon, which use the new status effects.
 * Thermite Bomb uses a new ammunition type.
 * Weapon select now begins from 1 instead of 0. Now you don't have to reach all the way across the
   keyboard to equip a Railgun.
 * Added tips section to the help menu, as well as information about the new weapons.

0.4.1 alpha 8/24/2019
 * Weapons which add heat to the target ship no longer do so upon a miss.
 * Added additional victory messages depending on the state of the player ship's armor.

0.4.0 alpha 8/21/2019
 * Added engines and shields as subsystems (alongside PD), which can be damaged via enemy fire.
 * Repairing your ship now gives you the option to repair a single damaged subsystem, or your armor.
 * Repairing armor now restores 15 health, from 10.
 * Critical hits now double the chance of damaging a subsystem.
 * Subsystem damage rate reduced to 10%, from 20%.
 * Added heat as a new mechanic.
 * In general, thermal weapons add the most heat, followed by EM, followed by kinetic. However, thermal
   weapons also tend to add heat to the target ship.
 * Option to shut down systems and bleed off more heat than usual, but this uses up the turn.
 * An overheating ship must shut down its systems; the player can choose to override this, but at a 20%
   chance of destroying their ship.

0.3.1 alpha 8/02/2019
 * Finished implementing lore, both a full and abridged version.
 * Added ability to view changelog in-game.

0.3.0 alpha 8/01/2019

 * Implemented lore and started work on the backstory. Still a work in progress.

0.2.3 alpha 7/30/2019
 * Implemented proper number formatting; most floating-point values will now print to two decimal places,
   while decimal points now align. Everything should look nicer now.
 * Lore (still) coming soon.

0.2.2 alpha 7/30/2019
 * Point-defenses now need a turn to re-activate after getting repaired. What this means is that your PD
   will not engage drones or missiles in the same turn when you repair them.
 * Lore coming soon.
 
0.2.1 alpha 7/29/2019
 * Added Drone Swarm, for both player and enemy use.
