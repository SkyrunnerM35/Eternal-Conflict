OVERVIEW
  In order to win the game, you must destroy your opponent's hull before he
  destroys yours. Both your ship and the enemy ship have 20 hull points, 
  which is protected by 150 armor points and 40 shield points; both the
  armor and shield must be defeated before the hull can be damaged.

RESISTANCES AND REGENERATION
  There are three different types of damage in the game; kinetic, thermal, 
  and electromagnetic. Shields and armor have different resistances to
  different types of damage, while hulls do not resist damage at all.
  Shields resist 50% of kinetic damage, 25% of thermal, and 0% of EM, while
  armor resists 10% kinetic, 35% thermal, and 60% EM.

  Shields automatically regenerate 2 points at the start of every turn (as
  long as your shield projector is undamaged), while armor must be
  manually repaired, using up your turn in the process. Hulls cannot be
  repaired, so keep your shields and armor up.
  
HEAT
  Both your ship and the enemy ship have 100 heat capacity, and most weapons
  will generate heat when fired. Generally speaking, thermal weapons
  generate the most heat, followed by EM, followed by kinetic. However, 
  thermal weapons also add heat to the target ship. Your ship's cooling
  system will remove 5 heat at the start of each turn, and you can use your
  turn to shut down your ship's systems, thus removing another 20 heat.
  An overheating ship must undergo an automatic shutdown, forfeiting the
  turn. However, the player can choose to override this shutdown with a
  chance for catastrophic failure (destroying the ship). This chance starts
  at 5%, and every override will increase the chance by an additional 5%.

**BREAK**

TURNS
  Each turn is summarized as follows:
    Shield Regen
    Ship Cooling
    Subsystem Re-Activation
    Decision
    Drones
    Point-Defense

SHIELD REGEN, SHIP COOLING, SUBSYSTEM ACTIVATION, AND DECISION
  At the start of each turn, your shields will regenerate 2 points if they
  are damaged, as mentioned above. Meanwhile, your onboard cooling systems
  will remove 5 heat. Moreover, if any subsystems were repaired in the
  previous turn, they will re-activate in this turn. During each turn, you
  can do one of five actions; fire weapons, repair your ship, attempt to
  dodge enemy fire, shut down your systems, or self-destruct.

FIRE WEAPONS
  Choosing to attack the enemy ship will then prompt you to use one of the
  three weapons in your arsenal, each with their strengths and weaknesses.
  If your enemy has active drones, you can choose to engage either the enemy
  ship or a random drone in their swarm, but not both.
  
**BREAK**

RAILGUN
  The Railgun is a kinetic weapon that fires a single 250mm osmium slug. It
  does 12 damage per hit before resistances, and as a kinetic weapon, it is
  strong against armor but weak against shields.

BEAM LASER
  The Beam Laser is a thermal weapon that fires a sustained beam to burn
  through the enemy ship. It does 12 damage per hit before resistances and
  is equally effective against both shields and armor; moreover, it also
  adds 8 heat to the target. However, damage-wise, a Railgun is better
  against armor, while a Plasma Cannon is better against shields.

PLASMA CANNON
  The Plasma Cannon generates a cloud of superheated plasma contained in a
  magnetic field that is fired towards the target. It does 12 EM damage per
  hit and is thus strong against shields but weak against armor.

**BREAK**

ROTARY CANNON
  A six-barreled Gatling weapon, the Rotary Cannon has a cyclic rate of 6000
  rounds per minute and fires a burst of ten 20mm shells. Each shell deals 1
  kinetic damage (10 damage in total), which makes it slightly weaker than
  the Railgun, but hit chances for each shell are calculated independently, 
  which makes this weapon ideal for attempting to hit targets with high
  evasion, as well as for disabling subsystems; it can hit multiple
  subsystems in one burst. The weapon is also unique in that its critical
  hit chance is 10%, which is twice that of the standard crit rate.
  
EMP CANNON
  A modern warship can do a lot of things; if you prevent the enemy ship
  from doing some of these things, you will have an advantage. The EMP
  Cannon discharges a single projectile that emits a strong magnetic field.
  It deals 4 EM damage, and should the shields be down after this, it will
  apply the Electromagnetic Pulse status effect for 2 turns; if the shields
  are still up after the initial impact, the effect will not be applied.

DRONE SWARM
  They say that unmanned vehicles are the future, and you're certainly
  taking advantage. Your frigate carries five attack drones, which are
  launched towards the enemy ship. Every turn, each drone will fire once at
  the enemy ship, dealing 2 thermal damage each. Each drone only has 2 armor
  and 1 hull, but they also have a 75% evasion rate, making them difficult
  to hit. An active point-defense, however, will shoot down a drone every
  turn with a 100% success rate.
  
**BREAK**

MISSILE LAUNCHER
  Putting the brains in the projectile means you can take them out of the
  gunner. The Missile Launcher fires a single radar-guided missile that
  deals 15 thermal damage, adds 6 heat to the target, and hits with 100%
  accuracy regardless of the enemy's evasion. However, if your enemy has an
  active PD, they will shoot down every missile. The launcher also has
  limited ammunition; you get ten missiles, so use them wisely.

CORROSION MISSILE
  Using the same launching system as the standard Missile Launcher, the
  Corrosion Missile functions similarly; you get finite ammunition and the
  missile is guaranteed to hit so long as the enemy's PD is down. But
  instead of a standard warhead, the Corrosion Missile carries a binary
  compound that, forms a highly adhesive, corrosive gel. The missile itself
  deals 4 kinetic damage on impact (enough to defeat shield regeneration),
  and should the shields be down after the initial impact, it will apply the
  Corrosion status effect for 3 turns; if the shields are not down after the
  initial impact, the effect will not be applied. Both the Missile Launcher
  and Corrosion Missile draw from the same ammunition pool (the desired 
  warhead is attached to the fuselage just before firing), meaning that if
  you take both weapons, you will have twenty missiles.
  
DESIGNATOR MISSILE
  If you can't stick a big gun on your ship, put it on another ship and aim
  it with a small gun. This is the point of the Designator Missile, which is
  a missile weapon that does 4 damage on impact and contains a probe which
  calls down five weapon shots (Railgun and/or Plasma Cannon depending on
  the target's shields) from nearby dreadnoughts; hit chance is based off of
  either five times the target's evasion or a flat 40% dodge rate, whichever
  is higher.
  
**BREAK**
  
THERMITE BOMB
  The Thermite Bomb is an unguided payload, meaning that it is countered by
  an active PD but can still miss a target normally. It deals no damage on
  impact, but instead adds 12 heat to the target and inflicts the Afterburn
  status effect for 3 turns. Similar to missile weapons, your ammunition for
  this weapon is finite; you get five bombs, use them wisely.

**BREAK**

CRITICAL HITS
  By default, all weapons have a 5% chance to deal a critical, which deals
  double damage compared to a normal shot. Crits also are also twice as
  likely to damage subsystems.

EVASION
  Both your ship and the enemy's have a 15% evasion rate, which means that
  your shot may miss the enemy, and vice versa.
  
SUBSYSTEM DAMAGE
  Any shot that damages your armor or hull will have a 10% chance of
  damaging a subsystem; only one subsystem may be damaged with each shot. A
  damaged point-defense system will open you up to certain weapons, a
  crippled engine will set your evasion to zero and prevent you from
  performing evasive maneuvers, and a damaged shield projector will disable
  your shield regeneration.
  
STATUS EFFECTS
  Status effects are applied via certain weapons or other events, and will
  last for a certain amount of turns. Just before the start of each turn, 
  all active status effects will inflict their... effects. Generally
  speaking, damage over time will stack, while other debuffs will not.
  
**BREAK**

CORROSION
  Inflicts 3 kinetic damage per turn, ignoring shields; will not crit or
  damage subsystems. Halves armor resistances.

AFTERBURN
  Inflicts 4 thermal damage per turn; will not crit or damage subsystems.
  Adds 5 heat per turn.
  
ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE
  Temporarily paralyzes all subsystems; this is not the same as damaging a
  subsystem, and paralyzed subsystems can still be damaged by weapons fire.

**BREAK**

ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS
  There exist a myriad of environments, each with their own effects. Each
  environment will last for at least three to eight turns, after which there
  will be a 35% chance to change environments at the end of each turn (both
  your's and your enemy's).
  
**BREAK**

OPEN SPACE
  The "default" environment. No effects.
  
STELLAR PROXIMITY
  The engagement is moved close to the sun, which will add 8 heat per turn
  to both ships. Moreover, there is a 10% chance for a solar flare per turn,
  which will add an additional 8 heat, inflict the Afterburn status effect
  for 4 turns, and inflict the Electromagnetic Pulse effect for 2 turns.
  
ASTEROID FIELD
  You and your adversary find yourselves in an asteroid thicket. Every turn,
  between 1 and 3 asteroids will head towards both ships, with hit chance
  based off of triple the target's evasion rate. Each asteroid impact will
  deal 6 kinetic damage, and since asteroids do not emit a heat signature,
  they cannot be detected and destroyed by PD.

**BREAK**

PLANETARY DEFENSES (ALLIED / ENEMY)
  The battle moves to the high orbit of a nearby planet, which is controlled
  by either the Terran Federation or Free Worlds; this in turn determines
  whether the planetary defenses are allied or not. After every turn, a
  weapon shot (Railgun or Plasma Cannon depending on the target's shields)
  is directed at either the player (if the defenses are hostile) or the
  enemy (if they are allied).
  
FLEET BATTLE
  A Federate and Free Worlds battle-group drop out of warp right on top of
  you and begin exchanging blows; both you and the enemy are now caught in
  the crossfire of multiple dreadnoughts. After every turn, five weapon
  shots (depending on the target's shields, some will be Railgun, others
  will be Plasma Cannon) are directed at both ships, with hit chance based
  off of either five times the target's evasion rate or a flat 40% dodge
  chance, whichever is higher; the effect is identical to that of the
  Designator Missile, and stacks with said weapon.
  
PLANETARY RINGS
  Both ships find themselves in the rings of a gas giant in the system, and
  the excess amount of particles in said rings interferes with their onboard
  sensors, effectively doubling evasion rates and leaving all missile
  weapons unable to get a lock.

**BREAK**

REPAIR SHIP
  Choosing to repair your ship will give you the option to repair either
  your armor (restoring 10 points), or a damaged subsystem. All subsystems
  require another turn to re-activate after being repaired, but cannot be
  damaged again during this re-activation turn.

EVASIVE MANEUVERS
  Choosing to try and dodge enemy fire will double your evasion rate to 30%
  for a single turn.

SHUT DOWN SYSTEMS
  Shutting down your ship's systems will disable all onboard systems except
  for critical ones such as shields, engines, and life support. As your ship
  will not generate as much heat as it does during normal operation, your
  cooling systems will be able to remove more heat than usual; specifically,
  they will remove an additional 20 heat. However, this will use up the
  turn.

SELF-DESTRUCT
  Choosing to self-destruct will overload your reactor and instantly destroy
  your ship. This will count as a defeat and quit the game.

**BREAK**

DRONES
  If you have active drones, they will attack the enemy ship following your
  decision. Each active drone will fire once.

POINT-DEFENSE
  Your point-defense guns, while active, will counter weapons that state "no
  PD" in their description. Most of such weapons, such as missiles, are
  simply shot down by the PD and immediately blocked. Drones, on the other
  hand, are not immediately countered by PD; instead, your point-defenses
  will shoot down an active enemy drone per turn. Be warned, though, the
  enemy ship is also equipped with point-defenses and can do the same.

TURN END
  After your turn ends, the enemy ship will take their turn, after which it
  will be your turn again. This repeats until either your ship or the enemy
  ship is destroyed.

**BREAK**

TIPS
  You are only given three weapon slots, so it is imperative that you pick
  an effective combination.
  
  Have a weapon capable of dealing good damage to shields. For instance, if
  you pick the Railgun, Rotary Cannon, and Missile Launcher, you will have a
  hard time getting through the first line of defense as the former two are
  kinetics and the latter is countered by PD, which cannot be disabled until
  the shields are down.
  
  The Drone Swarm, Missile Launcher, Corrosion Missile, Designator Missile,
  and Thermite Bomb are all countered by an active PD. As a result, if you
  pick one of the four, then you should also pick the Rotary Cannon or EMP
  Cannon so you can knock out subsystems.
  
  The above two statements combined means that if you take two of the above
  weapons, it will be difficult to make an effective weapon loadout. If you
  take three of the above weapons, then your entire loadout will countered
  by PD, leaving you unable to do any real damage.
  
**BREAK**
  
  The Rotary Cannon as a whole, although having less damage output than the
  other weapons, is a very good utility weapon. As each shot in its
  ten-round burst is calculated independently, it is ideal for hitting
  targets with high evasion, and can also disable multiple subsystems in one
  burst, even more so with its doubled crit rate, as critical hits are twice
  as likely to damage a subsystem. Finally, the Rotary Cannon generates less
  heat when compared to other weapons.
  
  The Railgun and Plasma Cannon are reliable damage-dealers; you can never
  go wrong with taking both of them.
  
  The Beam Laser attempts to be a middle-ground between the two; if you are
  taking a Rotary Cannon and Drone Swarm / Missile Launcher, then the Beam
  Laser is a viable choice for your third weapon. Note that although it
  generates the most heat out of all the weapons in the game, it does heat
  up the enemy ship as well; if you are solely using your Beam Laser and
  your enemy is solely firing a Plasma Cannon, the enemy ship will actually
  overheat first.
  
  The Designator Missile has the potential to deal extremely high damage, 
  but since the dreadnoughts' hit rate is based off of five times the
  target's evasion, the weapon heavily relies on chance.
  
**BREAK**

  Remember that a ship with an active shield projector will regenerate two
  shield at the start of every turn. This means that a Railgun shot will
  usually only deal 8 damage to the armor, as the other 4 damage will go to
  depleting the 2 shield. To deal the full 12 damage to the enemy's armor, 
  knock out the shield projector.
  
  Similarly, remember that a ship will remove five heat at the start of
  every turn. This means that in order to force the enemy ship to shut down, 
  you must raise the enemy ship's heat to 106.

  Despite your ship only having three weapon slots, the enemy ship is
  actually equipped with five weapons; specifically, the Railgun, Plasma
  Cannon, Rotary Cannon, Drone Swarm, and Missile Launcher.
  
  The enemy ship will prioritize repairing some components over others; most
  notably, if the enemy's armor is sufficiently low, they will prioritize
  repairing armor over the subsystems. If you have equipped a Drone Swarm, 
  that would be a good time to launch your drones.
  
**BREAK**

  As mentioned, shutting down your ship's systems only shuts down non-
  critical components. This means that your ship's shields, engines, and
  point-defenses will still be active when the enemy makes their move.
  Moreover, if you have active drones, they will still attack the enemy
  ship.
  
  When attacking drones, be it manually or via PD, a random drone will be
  targeted each time. You (or your point-defenses) are simply targeting the
  drone that is the easiest to hit at that moment, after all.
  
  Be aware that manually targeting drones only has a chance to destroy one, 
  while an active PD is guaranteed to destroy a drone while also freeing you
  up to attack the enemy ship in later turns. So if your PD is down, use
  your turn to repair your point-defenses instead of attacking the enemy's
  drones.
