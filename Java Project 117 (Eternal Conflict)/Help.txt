                                                                           | 77
                                                                           
OVERVIEW
  In order to win the game, you must destroy your opponent's hull before he
  destroys yours. Both your ship and the enemy ship have 20 hull points, 
  which is protected by 100 armor points and 40 shield points; both the
  armor and shield must be defeated before the hull can be damaged.

RESISTANCES AND REGENERATION
  There are three different types of damage in the game; kinetic, thermal, 
  and electromagnetic. Shields and armor have different resistances to
  different types of damage, while hulls do not resist damage at all.
  Shields resist 50% of kinetic damage, 25% of thermal, and 0% of EM, while
  armor resists 0% kinetic, 25% thermal, and 50% EM.

  Shields automatically regenerate 2 points at the start of every turn, 
  while armor must be manually repaired, using up your turn in the process.
  Hulls cannot be repaired, so keep your shields and armor up.

TURNS
  Each turn is summarized as follows:
    Shield Regen
    Decision
    Drones
    Point-Defense

**BREAK**

SHIELD REGEN AND DECISION
  At the start of each turn, your shields will regenerate 2 points if they
  are damaged, as mentioned above. During each turn, you can do one of four
  actions; fire weapons, repair your ship, attempt to dodge enemy fire, or
  self-destruct.

FIRE WEAPONS
  Choosing to attack the enemy ship will then prompt you to use one of the
  three weapons in your arsenal, each with their strengths and weaknesses.
  If your enemy has active drones, you can choose to engage either the enemy
  ship or a random drone in their swarm, but not both.

RAILGUN
  The railgun is a kinetic weapon that fires a single 250mm osmium slug.
  It does 12 damage per hit before resistances, and as a kinetic weapon, 
  it is strong against armor but weak against shields.

BEAM LASER
  The beam laser is a thermal weapon that fires a sustained beam to burn
  through the enemy ship. It does 12 damage per hit before resistances and
  is equally effective against both shields and armor. However, a railgun is
  better against armor, while a plasma cannon is better against shields.

PLASMA CANNON
  The plasma cannon generates a cloud of superheated plasma contained in a
  magnetic field that is fired towards the target. It does 12 EM damage
  per hit and is thus strong against shields but weak against armor.

**BREAK**

ROTARY CANNON
  A six-barreled Gatling weapon, the rotary cannon has a cyclic rate of
  6000 rounds per minute and fires a burst of ten 20mm shells. Each shell
  deals 1 kinetic damage (10 damage in total), which makes it slightly
  weaker than the railgun, but hit chances for each shell are calculated
  independently, which makes this weapon ideal for attempting to hit
  targets with high evasion, as well as for disabling subsystems such as PD.
  The weapon is also unique in that its critical hit chance is 10%, which is
  twice that of the standard crit rate.

DRONE SWARM
  They say that unmanned vehicles are the future, and you're certainly
  taking advantage. Your frigate carries five attack drones, which are
  launched towards the enemy ship. Every turn, each drone will fire once at
  the enemy ship, dealing 2 thermal damage each. Each drone only has 2 armor
  and 1 hull, but they also have a 75% evasion rate, making them difficult
  to hit. An active point-defense, however, will shoot down a drone every
  turn with a 100% success rate.

MISSILE LAUNCHER
  Putting the brains in the projectile means you can take them out of the
  gunner. The missile launcher fires a single radar-guided missile that
  deals 15 thermal damage and hits with 100% accuracy regardless of the
  enemy's evasion. However, if your enemy has an active PD, they will shoot
  down every missile you fire at them. The launcher also has limited
  ammunition; you get ten missiles, so use them wisely.

**BREAK**

CRITICAL HITS
  By default, all weapons have a 5% chance to deal a critical, which deals
  double damage compared to a normal shot.

EVASION
  Both your ship and the enemy's have a 15% evasion rate, which means that
  your shot may miss the enemy, and vice versa.

REPAIR SHIP
  Choosing to repair your ship will instantly restore 10 armor points and
  repair your point-defenses if they were damaged. Newly-repaired point-
  defenses will require another turn to re-activate.

EVASIVE MANEUVERS
  Choosing to try and dodge enemy fire will double your evasion rate to 30%
  for a single turn.

SELF-DESTRUCT
  Choosing to self-destruct will overload your reactor and instantly destroy
  your ship. This will count as a defeat and quit the game.

**BREAK**

DRONES
  If you have active drones, they will attack the enemy ship following your
  decision. Each active drone will fire once.

POINT-DEFENSE
  Your point-defense guns, while active, will protect you from enemy
  missiles. Moreover, if your enemy has active drones, they will shoot down
  a random drone per turn right after your drones attack the enemy. It
  should be noted that any damage to your armor or hull will have a 20%
  chance of disabling your PD.

TURN END
  After your turn ends, the enemy ship will take their turn, after which it
  will be your turn again. This repeats until either your ship or the enemy
  ship is destroyed.
